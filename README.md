# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

I'm going to be testing several tools and ways of performing sentiment analysis on tweets about the US financial market in this repo.

Since this is more of a personal project, you'll hardly find any documentation anywhere...but basically:

- A Twitter scraper, built with Scrapy - I'm using hashtags for now (you won't find any of the raw data though, since I'm running it in my raspberry pi)
- Several tests with different sent analysis strategies/approaches

After these tests, I'll move on to build news sent analysis.

If for any reason you feel this is the kind of project you'd love to be a part of, let me know!

Cheers,

-Ricardo
